Code to create MRBC Accessions. This tool is for rare book archivists to bulk add accession records to ArchivesSpace, instead of manually creating individual accession records. Create a copy of template file and edit the file with the appropriate metadata. For controlled values, use the human-readable version (e.g., Author, not aut).
